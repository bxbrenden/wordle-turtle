A Firefox extension that came to me in a dream.

## Explanation
I do the Wordle every morning right when I wake up.
While I was still dreaming, my brain somehow mish-mashed "Wordle" together with the phrase "Turtle, Turtle" from [The Master of Disguise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_of_Disguise).

I imagined a Firefox extension that would replace every letter tile with a gif of Dana Carvey as the turtle man.

I woke up laughing, so I sat down and prototyped it. It works poorly (using the JavaScript `setTimeout` function blindly) and will probably break soon, but I gave myself a good chuckle.
